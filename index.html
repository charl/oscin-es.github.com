        <p><a href="https://github.com/oscin-es/oscin-es.github.com">Oscines</a> is a JavaScript library based on the standard logical combinators as well as a number of practical combinators and function decorators introduced in the book <a href="http://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge">JavaScript Allongé</a>.</p>

<h3>The Code</h3>

<p>There are three kinds of functions in the library. Functions with the capitalized nickname of a bird are fixed arity forms of the combinators, e.g. `function Cardinal (a, b, c)`, `function Thrush (a, b)`. Functions with a capitalized abbreviated name are curried forms that match the semantics of combinatory logic, e.g. `C` is the curried form of `Cardinal`. Functions with lower-case names are practical JavaScript combinators and function decorators, e.g. `once`, `variadic`.</p>

<h3>Songbirds</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192801422/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0192801422">To Mock a Mockingbird</a> established the metaphor of songbirds for the combinators, and ever since then logicians have called the K combinator a "kestrel," the B combinator a "bluebird," and so forth. In Raymond Smullyan's book, when you call out the song of a bird, each songbird responds with a song denoting a songbird. For example, the Identity bird sings back the name of the bird you sang to it. From the presence of a few simple birds in a forest, you can deduce all of programming.</p>

  <p>This is why a JavaScript library dedicated to combinator functions is named after <a href="https://github.com/oscin-es/oscin-es.github.com">Oscines</a>, the songbirds.
</p>

<h3>Project Status</h3>

<p>Under construction, barely an alpha. All of the combinators and function decorators from <a href="http://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge">JavaScript Allongé</a> are present. The logical combinators from Bluebird to Dovekiss are present. There are no tests or further documentation.</p>
